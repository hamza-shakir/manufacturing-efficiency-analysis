## 🚀 **Key Highlights**  
1. **Data Consolidation**:  
   - Utilized **XLOOKUP** to merge data from multiple sub-sheets, creating a unified dashboard for better visibility into productivity metrics.  

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:  
   - Employed **pivot tables** to identify frequent downtime factors such as **_machine failures_** and **_inventory shortages_**, which were significant contributors to inefficiency.  

3. **Efficiency Improvement**:  
   - Highlighted that addressing key downtime causes could lead to a **20% improvement in overall line efficiency**.  

4. **Operator Training Insights**:  
   - Pinpointed training gaps for operators in areas like machine adjustments and batch changeovers, with tailored recommendations for improvement.


## 📊 **Findings**  
- **Downtime Analysis**: Frequent issues include machine failures and inventory shortages during batch production.  
- **Operator Challenges**:  
  - Machine adjustments were a recurring issue, especially for some operators (e.g., Dennis).  
  - Batch changeovers presented challenges for others (e.g., Mac).  


## 🛠️ **Impact**  
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Proposed targeted training programs and process improvements to enhance manufacturing line efficiency.  
- **Predicted Outcome**: If implemented, these changes could result in a **_significant productivity boost of close to 20%_**.  


## 📈 **Tools Used**  
- **Excel**: XLOOKUP, pivot tables, and charts for data analysis and visualization.
